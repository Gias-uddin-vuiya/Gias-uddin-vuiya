# Hello! ðŸ‘‹  
I'm Gias uddin vuiya (Gias-uddin-vuiya), a self-taught developer from Bangladesh, currently deepening my knowledge of computer science through Harvardâ€™s CS50 program. My work focuses on full-stack web development, competitive programming, and building real-world web applications.

Currently, I'm focused on completing my CS50P (Python) final project and enhancing my skills through CS50W (Web Programming). In addition, I am preparing to apply to Harvard Extension School to further my education in computer science.

My GitHub repository list serves as a good start for what I've done. However, I also contribute and work on various projects over at my [Gias uddin vuiya GitHub](https://github.com/Gias-uddin-vuiya). Feel free to take a look at that list too!
